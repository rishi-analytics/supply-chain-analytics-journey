# ðŸ“¦ Assignment 1: Impact of COVID-19 on Wolt's Delivery Supply Chain

## ðŸ“– Real Story / Example

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the global food delivery sector witnessed an unprecedented surge in demand. **Wolt**, a leading food delivery company founded in Finland, faced major supply chain challenges throughout the covid period i.e., 2020 and 2021.

With lockdowns imposed across Europe, Wolt saw its customer base and order volumes skyrocket. In Finland alone, the company reported a doubling of delivery orders in major cities like Helsinki within a few months in 2020. However, this boom exposed several supply chain vulnerabilities:

- **Sourcing issues**: Many restaurants which were Wolt's core suppliers, temporarily closed or faced ingredient shortages, disrupting the availability of menu items.

- **Logistics bottlenecks**: Wolt experienced a shortage of couriers (delivery partners) as mobility restrictions, health concerns, and quarantine rules limited the available workforce. In some cities, delivery times increased considerably, causing customer dissatisfaction.

- **Operational strain**: To meet the sudden demand, Wolt had to rapidly onboard new couriers, but training and equipping them (with delivery gear, thermal bags, etc.) presented its own logistical challenges.

According to public reports, Woltâ€™s delivery volumes grew over **3x globally** between 2019 and 2021, but these gains came probably at the cost of increased operational expenses and customer complaints related to delivery delays.

## ðŸ”— How is this story related to Supply Chain Management?

This example highlights multiple critical components of supply chain management:

- **Sourcing**: Disruptions in restaurant operations led to inventory shortages and reduced supply availability.

- **Logistics**: Shortages of couriers and extended delivery times directly impacted the efficiency of Wolt's last-mile delivery network.

- **Service/Selling**: Longer wait times and limited restaurant choices impacted Wolt's ability to fulfill customer demand, a critical part of their service chain.

Thus, the story ties closely to **sourcing, logistics, and selling** encompassing all core pillars of the supply chain.

## ðŸ’¸ Financial / Social / Economic Impact

The supply chain disruptions had both **economic** and **social** impacts:

- **Economic Impact**: Despite revenue growth, Wolt faced higher operational costs due to urgent hiring and incentives for couriers, leading to thinner profit margins.

- **Social Impact**: Customers experienced longer wait times and limited restaurant options, reducing service satisfaction. Significant number of customers reported delivery delays or unavailability of preferred restaurants during peak lockdown periods.

On the restaurant side, supply shortages and closures meant lost income and, in some cases, permanent shutdowns, impacting the broader local economy.

So in conclusion, while the food delivery sector boomed, **supply chain inefficiencies highlighted the fragility of even tech-optimized services like Wolt during global crises**.
